# Repository Check Explanation

Each check against a repository will result in one of the following statuses:
- 🟢: The check passed, indicating that the repository meets the requirement.
- 🔴: The check failed, indicating that the repository does not meet the requirement.
- 🟠: The check passed conditionally, indicating that while the repository meets the requirement, improvements are needed.
- 🔵: Indicates there's an open issue ticket regarding the repository.
- 🟣: Indicates there's an open pull-request proposing a best practice.

## License
- The repository must contain a file named either `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.txt`.
- 🟢: The check will pass if either of these files is present.
- 🔴: The check will fail if neither file is present.
- 🟣: If a pull-request is proposed to add the `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.txt`.
- 🔵: If an issue is opened to suggest adding the `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.txt`.

## README
